# Mod 1 Week 5 Assessment

## Questions (10 Points Possible)
1. What would happen if you try to use a variable that is not in scope?
We would get a compiler error stating that the var is not accessible.
2. Describe the three As of a test:  
A -   Arrange
A -   Act
A -   Assert

3. What is the difference between `public` and `private` access modifiers?
  In public access modifier the code is accessible by all classes but in Private access modifier the code is only accessible from within the same class.
4. A method should:  (**Select all that apply**) <br/>
(A) Make changes to an object  
(B) Return some information about an object  
(C) Make changes to an object and return information about the object.  
(D) None of the Above.  (this or a and b separately.)


5. How did you determine what to answer for the question above?
a method should either make changes or return information, it can do both but thats not a good method and and not the recommended way.
## Exercise (10 Points Possible)

Clone your forked copy of this repository into Visual Studio.  

In this solution, there is a User project with a single User class.  The class works, but it needs some additional effort to be great! One thing that is missing is tests; your job is to write the tests that will confirm the functionality of the class. Write one test for the constructor, and at least one test for each of the other 4 methods. As you write the tests, you might find some refactoring opportunities; update the user class with any refactors you deem necessary and add a comment describing why you made that refactor.  The only rule is that all the existing methods must still exist when you are finished!


## Submission

When finished:
* Commit your changes in Visual Studio
* Push up to GitHub
